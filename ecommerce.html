                            <li><a href="/security"><strong>Security:</strong></a> With a custom built e-commerce system, you can implement robust security measures that are specific to your business, which can help to protect sensitive customer information.</li>
                            <li><strong>Customizability:</strong> A custom built e-commerce system allows for greater flexibility in terms of design and functionality. You can tailor the system to your specific business needs and requirements, which can give you a competitive edge.</li>
